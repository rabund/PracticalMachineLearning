# PracticalMachineLearning
Course Project for the peer-graded assignment of the course "Practical Machine Learning"

Author: Ralf Bund

The included files belong to the peer-graded assignment. The following files are included:

* README.md; this file
* CourseProject.Rmd; the R markdown file containing code and documentation of the project
* CourseProject.html; result of the compiled markdown file

The data are loaded from the following links:

* training data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
* testing data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

To run the markdown file, the two files have to reside in the R working directory.
